**WARN: (ENCEXT-1085):	Option 'rda_Input(ui_res_scale)' used in configuration file 'c35b4_std.conf' is obsolete. The name will be converted into new format automatically if design is saved and then restored. Alternatively, update the configuration file to use names 'rda_Input(ui_preRoute_res)' and/or 'rda_Input(ui_postRoute_res)' for resistance scale factors to be used at preRoute/postRoute stages of the design . The obsolete name works in this release. But to avoid this warning and to ensure compatibility with future releases, update this option name.
**WARN: (ENCSYT-709):	The next major release of EDI (11.1) will use the
Multi-Mode/Multi-Corner (MMMC) architecture exclusively for configuration and
control of some software features. The current configuration will continue to
work in this release. But for compatibility with the future releases you
should migrate your design to an MMMC style configuration. You can refer to
the What's New document for this release for additional information on the
11.1 migration to MMMC. In addition, you can run loadConfig with the
-showEolWarnings option to identify specific command and configuration
options that will no longer be supported.

**WARN: (ENCSYT-20004):	Both ui_leffile and ui_oa_reflib are defined. Standard Cell and Technology data will be read from the LEF files specified in ui_leffile. Libraries defined in ui_oa_reflib will be used to read custom layers from OA. If OA reference libraries are available, the recommended method is to only define ui_oa_reflib and not define ui_leffile. Using the OpenAccess information as the only source of technology removes the need to manually keep the two definitions in sync.

**WARN: (ENCLF-228):	 ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any OUTPUT PIN or INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often
causes a mismatch between process antenna violations found in Encounter
(during routing or verify) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in LEF
5.5. The recommended solution is to remove ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA and add
ANTENNADIFFAREA to all OUTPUT or INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to
avoid a mismatch in violations.
**WARN: (ENCLF-230):	 ANTENNAINOUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often causes a
mismatch between process antenna violations found in Encounter (during
routing or verify) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in
LEF 5.5. The recommended solution is to remove ANTENNAINOUTDIFFAREA
and add ANTENNADIFFAREA to all INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to

Note that setting a very large number using the set_message_limit command
or removing the message limit using the unset_message_limit command can
significantly increase the log file size.
To suppress a message, use suppress_message command.
